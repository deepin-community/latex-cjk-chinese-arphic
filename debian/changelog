       copyright.in, README.Debian]

         Debian package which contains version 1.7 of the Adobe Glyph
         List For New Fonts.  Update latex-cjk/makefdx.pl to point to
         the aglfn.txt file from the `aglfn' package.
  * [compat]
     - Bump up version from v7 to v9.

     - Switch from dh_clean to dh_prep;
     - add a "sed" line to replace @PROVIDESFILE@ in font.fd.in;

       correctly.
  * [font.fd.in]
     - Change the hard-coded "c70gkai.fd" into @PROVIDESFILE@.

latex-cjk-chinese-arphic (1.21) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "Welcome to TeX Live 2009" release.
  * Set the urgency to medium, because it fixes an FTBFS bug.
  * [rules]
     - Do not show some of the more technical comments on the
       terminal;
     - add "ttf2pk/" to the sfddir variable because the upstream
       path to the Subfont Definition (SFD) files has changed.
       This fixes "FTBFS: No Sub Font Definition file", thanks to
       Lucas Nussbaum (Closes: #562395).
  * [control] Because of bug #562395, this package now depends
     on texlive-font-utils (>= 2009-4).

latex-cjk-chinese-arphic (1.20) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "OMG, am I really a DD now?!" release.
  * Set the urgency to medium, because it fixes an FTBFS bug.
  * [rules]
     - Fix some more bashisms which cause an FTBFS.  Thanks to Raphael
       Geissert and Lucas Nussbaum (Closes: #535389, #543020);
     - change copyright from 2008 to 2009.
  * [font.fd.in]
     - Add \CJKnormal to the {m}{n} regular shape to all fonts that use
       \CJKbold because NFSS doesn't call \selectfont when substituting
       fonts, and therefore the \CJK@bold@ does not reset.  Fix from the
       upstream author of the CJK package;
     - update file version to 4.8.1 and date to 2008-10-03.
  * [control.stem.in]
     - Build-depend on tex-common (>= 1.20) to get trigger support;
     - bump to Standards-Version from 3.8.0 to 3.8.3 (no changes).
  * [control.leaf.in] Do not depend on tex-common anymore, but use
     ${misc:Depends} instead.
  * [latex-cjk/*] Get latest upstream version of the CJK scripts (4.8.2).
  * [changelog] Change the maintainer's email address.
  * [TODO] Remove the todo about skewed (i.e. italics) glyphs because
     the result is rather ugly.

latex-cjk-chinese-arphic (1.19) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "Where art thou, oh vertical fonts" release.
  * Urgency set to medium, as this release fixes an FTBFS bug.
  * [rules]
     - Fix problem in the $(clean_fonts) rule when running target "clean"
       with -j: some debian/control entries could be missing.  Thanks to
       Lucas Nussbaum for the patch (Closes: #465635);
     - with debhelper V7 you don't need to manually remove the *-stamp
       files anymore;
     - replace "dh_clean -k" with "dh_prep";
     - README.Debian was installed by dh_installdocs only in the first
       binary package that appeared in debian/control.  Install this file
       in all four binary packages;
     - bump copyright to 2008, and change from GPLv2 to GPLv2+;
     - remove the exhaustive error and log handling;
     - only build support for vertical writing for fonts that actually do
       have a proper GSUB table, to know "bsmi" and "bkai"; "gbsn" and "gkai"
       don't, so we compile the vertical fonts for gbsn and gkai with pltotf
       and vptovf.
  * [copyright.in]
     - Bump copyright to 2008;
     - change the link to /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2 instead of /GPL,
       which is now symlinked to /GPL-3.
  * [compat] Bump debhelper compatibility to level 7.
  * [control.stem.in]
     - Depend on debhelper (>= 7);
     - bump Standards-Version from 3.7.3 to 3.8.0;
     - fix package descriptions for bsmi, gbsn and gkai.  Thanks to
       FENG Yu-ning (Closes: #478078);
     - Bug fix: Build-Depend-Indep on texlive-font-utils (>= 2007.dfsg.2)
       instead of the deprecated freetype1-tools.  Thanks to Norbert Preining
       and madcoder (Closes: #484081);
     - add "sharutils" to the Build-Depends-Indep list to unpack the vertical
       fonts;
     - build-depend on tex-common version 1.11.2 or higher, which fixes a
       debhelper and Emacs error.  Thanks to Norbert Preining;
     - switch from Xs-Vcs-* to Vcs-*;
     - use the correct SVN address from Debian Alioth, not from
       upstream's GIT repository.
  * [gbsn*,gkai*] I got these files from versions 1.18 and 1.15, when the
     Fontforge scripts didn't bail out if the TTF didn't contain a valid GSUB
     table.
  * [TODO] Add a reminder that I should either fix the vertical support for
     gbsn and gkai, or either completely remove support for it.
  * [README.Debian] Update dependencies.
  * [watch] Remove this file; it is of no use, because the Arphic fonts will
     never be updated again, and because this package is a Debian native
     package.
  * Changes by the sponsor, Norbert Preining:
     [README.Debian] Fix the location of the SFD fonts.
     [rules] Fix the location of the SFD fonts.
     [control] Remove double occurrence of texlive-font-utils in the
      build-depends-indep.

latex-cjk-chinese-arphic (1.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "I love vertical writing" release.
  * [changelog]
     - Remove a superfluous item from 1.17;
     - typo in 1.17.
  * [latex-cjk/makefdx.pl] Remove hoffset again.  This setting
     is applied not only after \CJKhorz, but after \CJKvert, which
     isn't exactly what we want.
  * [latex-cjk/{*.pe,*.pl}] Upstream update.
  * [control.stem.in]
     - Build-Depend on fontforge (>= 0.0.20071105);
     - bump Standards-Version from 3.7.2.0 to 3.7.3;
     - depend on debhelper (>= 6).
  * [compat] Move to debhelper compatibility level 6.
  * [rules]
     - makefdx.pl now requires an extra "encoding" argument.
       Also use the "-u" flag when creating Unicode .fdx files;
     - use $(MY_DH_OPTIONS) instead of $(DH_OPTIONS).  Now it shouldn't
       break anymore on parallel computers, making the compilation much
       faster.  Thanks to Lucas Nussbaum (Closes: #458740);
     - removed a possible bashism, changing "{,x}" into "*".
  * [*.preinst] dh_installtex has moved the default priority from 10 to
     20, rendering the /etc/texmf/updmap.d/10latex-cjk-chinese*.cfg
     conffiles obsolete.  This script will create a backup in
     /etc/texmf/updmap.d/ if you have manually modified any of the 10*.cfg
     file.  Thanks to Kumar Appaiah
     (Closes: #455461, #455462, #455463, #455464).

latex-cjk-chinese-arphic (1.17) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Set urgency to "medium" to fix two FTBFS bugs.
  * [latex-cjk/vert*.pe] Remove the line with SelectByAtt, which has been
      made deprecated upstream.  This fixes "FTBFS: Fontforge doesn't
      support SelectByATT anymore" (Closes: #424999).
  * [control.stem.in]
     - Remove "tetex-bin" in Build-Depends-Indep.
       This fixes "FTBFS: latex-cjk-chinese-arphic-bsmi00lp missing files
       (build/bsmi00lp/bsmilp*.tfm), aborting" (Closes: #422828).
       Thanks to Michael Ablassmeier and Lucas Nussbaum;
     - put "debhelper" in Build-Depends, the rest of the packages in
       Build-Depends-Indep.  Thanks to Florent Rougon;
     - minor cleanups.
  * [rules]
     - Some of the logs weren't directed yet to $(builddir)/;
     - add a few arguments after "dh_testdir" when cleaning, to make
       sure we're deleting the correct directory.  Thanks to Florent Rougon.

latex-cjk-chinese-arphic (1.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Circular dependencies go poof" release.
  * [control]
     - don't depend on latex-cjk-chinese.
       Thanks to Bill Allombert. (Closes: #396214);
     - reverse the order of the build-dependency on TeX packages,
       making TeXlive the preferred flavour;
     - remove the conflict (versioned) with and the replacement (unversioned)
       of tfm-arphic-@TYPEFACE@ (= 2.11.2-0.1), since they have now been
       removed in Debian/testing;
     - remove the virtual packages tfm-arphic-@TYPEFACE@.  A "Provides:" tag
       should be sufficient.
  * [rules]
     - fix typo in a comment;
     - don't redirect all the output to build/[font]/log, but also
       to stdout (using "tee"), making sure that tools like piuparts
       don't interpret the hour-long builds with inactivity.
       (Closes: #398517).  Thanks to Lucas Nussbaum;
     - output the current command also to the logfile.  This makes it
       easier to trace bugs;
     - change wording of the comments, to make it clear that compiling
       these fonts will take a day, not just hours; thanks to
       Werner LEMBERG.
  * [README.Debian] add a new section about how to get GBK fonts as well,
     taking the Arphic fonts as an example.  In the near future I will
     merge this info with the Cyberbit section into one document in the
     latex-cjk-common package.

     It improves my efficiency with 0,1%.
  * [control.leaf.in]
      add tfm-arphic-* to each package's Replaces: list.

  * [README.Debian] mention that switching to the new Type1 fonts
     requires the old PK fonts to be removed ~/.texmf-var/.
  * [rules] according to Debian Policy section 4.6, it is advised
     to use a double ampersand instead of a semicolon because of
